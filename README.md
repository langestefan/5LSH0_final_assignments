# 5LSH0_final_assignments
This repository contains my code for the final assignments for 5LSH0 Computer vision and 3D image processing course at the TU/e. I suspect that this code will be indexed by google as such. Therefore if you are a student of this course and come across this code, I have gotten good grades for each of these assignments (9+). I already have my results so you can do with this code whatever you want.

### Checklist:

- [x] Assignment 1: Basic multilayer perceptron (MLP)
- [x] Assignment 2: Re-identification (Re-id)
- [x] Assignment 3: 3D Pointcloud filter based on vertical column aggregation
